          We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Laravel. There are a variety of options for developing and running a Laravel project on your own computer. While you may wish to explore these options at a later time,
          Laravel provides Sail, a built-in solution for running your Laravel project using Docker.
        </p>

        <p>
          Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small, light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with your local computer's installed software or configuration. This means you don't have to worry about configuring
          or setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and databases on your personal computer. To get started, you only need to install Docker Desktop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration. Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without
          requiring prior Docker experience.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Configuration">
        <header>Configuration</header>

        <p>It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the environment where the application is running. For example, you may wish to use a different cache driver locally than you do on your production server.</p>

        <p>
          To make this a cinch, Laravel utilizes the DotEnv PHP library. In a fresh Laravel installation, the root directory of your application will contain a <code>.env.example</code> file that defines many common environment variables.
          During the Laravel installation process, this file will automatically be copied to <code>.env</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Laravel's default <code>.env</code> file contains some common configuration values that may differ based on whether your application is running locally or on a production web server. These values are then retrieved from various
          Laravel configuration files within the <code>config</code> directory using Laravel's <code>env</code> function.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are developing with a team, you may wish to continue including a <code>.env.example</code> file with your application. By putting placeholder values in the example configuration file, other developers on your team can
          clearly see which environment variables are needed to run your application.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Directory_Structure">
        <header>Directory Structure</header>
        <p>The majority of your application is housed in the <code>app</code> directory. By default, this directory is namespaced under <code>App</code> and is autoloaded by Composer using the PSR-4 autoloading standard.</p>

        <p>
          The <code>app</code> directory contains a variety of additional directories such as <code>Console</code>, <code>Http</code>, and <code>Providers</code>. Think of the <code>Console</code> and <code>Http</code> directories as
          providing an API into the core of your application. The HTTP protocol and CLI are both mechanisms to interact with your application, but do not actually contain application logic. In other words, they are two ways of issuing
          commands to your application. The <code>Console</code> directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the <code>Http</code> directory contains your controllers, middleware, and requests.
        </p>

        <p>
          A variety of other directories will be generated inside the <code>app</code> directory as you use the <code>make</code> Artisan commands to generate classes. So, for example, the <code>app/Jobs</code> directory will not exist
          until you execute the <code>make:job</code> Artisan command to generate a job class.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Starter_Kits">
        <header>Starter Kits</header>
        <p>
          To give you a head start building your new Laravel application, we are happy to offer authentication and application starter kits. These kits automatically scaffold your application with the routes, controllers, and views you need
          to register and authenticate your application's users.
        </p>

        <p>
          While you are welcome to use these starter kits, they are not required. You are free to build your own application from the ground up by simply installing a fresh copy of Laravel. Either way, we know you will build something
          great!

        <p>The Laravel framework has a few system requirements. You should ensure that your web server has the following minimum PHP version and extensions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>PHP >= 7.3</li>
          <li>BCMath PHP Extension</li>
          <li>Ctype PHP Extension</li>
          <li>Fileinfo PHP Extension</li>
          <li>JSON PHP Extension</li>
          <li>Mbstring PHP Extension</li>
          <li>OpenSSL PHP Extension</li>
          <li>PDO PHP Extension</li>
          <li>Tokenizer PHP Extension</li>
          <li>XML PHP Extension</li>
        </ul>
